// TODO-List
// Some smaller TODO tasks are scattered around the code - search for "// TODO"

// This list is incomplete; you can help by expanding it


// TODO: Revise the search algorithm
  // Right now, we're just brute-forcing through all 64*64 possibly legal moves, and choose the best. Obviously that's
  // kinda shitty and we should rather use something like min/max.
  

// TODO: Revise the board scoring function
  // Right now, we just use ChessBoard#getMaterialScore for the AI to evaluate moves. Replace with either some more
  // clever function or machine learning  

// TODO: Graphical user interface
  // Not necessarily in C++. Maybe easier to use other languages/frameworks and just wrap around the CLI, but of course
  // if you're into pain then C++ works too


// TODO: Opening book
  // Let's add an opening book! Doesn't need to be a big one, maybe our own.


// TODO: Endgame database
  // Endgames with fewer than 5 pieces can be pre-calculated. Some popular endgame tablebases are Szyzygy or Lomonosov,
  // but it would be cool if we managed to get up with our own format
  // (Note that this has a bigger priority than the opening book, as per UCI standard engines do not need to provide
  // their own opening books but should provide their own endgame databases)


// TODO: Unit tests
  // Any new feature might break an old one. We should be able to detect that somehow, therefore we need unit tests


// TODO: Modularize ChessEngine code
  // Create an interface for ChessEngines and make the current one implement that, so we can create multiple engines
  // and make them fight each other

// TODO: 128-bit cache names
  // So far, we're using 192-bit cache names. Try to go for 128
