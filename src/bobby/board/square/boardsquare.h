 * A structure representing either a single piece, or an empty square.
 * 
 * A board square can be either one of the six pieces of one of the two colors, or empty. Internally, it is stored as
 * an integer in the binary format 0bBWPKBRQK, whereas one of WB is set for white/black, and one of PKBRQK is set for
 * the piece type. The empty square is stored as 0. This allows some efficient binary trickery.
